# Amazon Product Review Sentiment Classifier

This project uses traditional machine learning techniques to classify 34,000+ Amazon product reviews by sentiment (positive, neutral, negative). A complete pipeline was developed for preprocessing, feature engineering, SMOTE oversampling, and model evaluation. The final ensemble model balances performance across classes while avoiding the resource demands of deep learning.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- Preprocessed raw text using lowercase, stopword removal, punctuation cleanup
- Engineered TF-IDF vectors (1-2 n-grams, top 5K features)
- Balanced dataset using SMOTE to overcome extreme class imbalance (93% positive)
- Trained and compared Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM
- Final ensemble classifier achieved:
  - **Accuracy**: 84.5%
  - **Macro F1 Score**: 0.48
- Feature importance analysis revealed top indicators for each sentiment class
